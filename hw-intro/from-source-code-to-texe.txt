i386-gcc -m32 -S -o recurse.S recurse.c

the .text section contains the program code and the .data contains the statically initialized data of the program 

i386-objdump --syms object_file_name

a set of characters and spaces indicating flag bits that are set on the symbol. g means global
*UND* means section is referenced in the file being dumped but not defined there

f means the symbol is the name of a file 
O means the symbol is the name of an object

.text contains recur
SYMBOL TABLE contains stuff and foo

no stack and heap are not part of the object file but instead are dynamic areas in memory

the addresses of variables that are stack allocated are lower than old ones so the stack grows downwards from high memory addresses to low memory addresses
